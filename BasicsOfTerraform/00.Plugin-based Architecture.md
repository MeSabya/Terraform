## Plugin-based Architecture

Terraform is written in the Go programming language (Golang) and provided as a single binary that includes core components required to parse and deploy Terraform configurations. It doesnâ€™t include the code necessary to interact with various providers and provisioners. That code is supplied via plugins. Each plugin is executed as a separate process communicating with the core Terraform binary using an RPC interface.

### Key takeaways
Terraform makes use of plugins for its providers and provisioners instead of bundling them in the core binary.


ðŸ‘‰ Terraform provides us to have multiple AWS providers by creating aliases.

ðŸ‘‰ **There are multiple use cases where provider alias can be used:**

- Creating resources in multiple AWS accounts in the same terraform module.
- Creating resources in different regions of the same AWS account.
- Creating resources in different regions of the different AWS accounts.

## What is a provider?
Providers are Terraform plugins that are used to interact with remote systems such as Docker, AWS, Azureâ€¦

Hereâ€™s an example of how to configure the AWS provider in Terraform using code:

main.tf

Configure the AWS provider
```tf
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
  secret_key = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"
  region     = "us-west-2"
}
```
### Types of Terraform providers
With the introduction of version 0.13, providers can be automatically downloaded from a public or private repository. The official public repository for Terraform is located at registry.terraform.io, which includes three types of providers:

- Official: Official providers are owned and maintained by HashiCorp.
- Verified: Verified providers are maintained by other vendors but have gone through the partner provider process.
- Community: Community providers are published and maintained by individuals and arenâ€™t officially supported.

### Add providers in Terraform code block#
Providers can be added through a required_providers nested block inside the terraform code block. An example is shown below:

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}
```
Each provider has a local name used by the local configuration. The local name can be the same as the provider name or customized as needed. In the example above, the local name is aws, which is the preferred local name for the AWS provider.
