## Terraform Provisioner

- Provisioners are used for executing scripts or shell commands on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation/deletion. 
- They are similar to **“EC2 instance user data”** scripts that only run once on the creation and if it fails terraform marks it tainted. 
- A tainted resource is one which is planned for destruction on next terraform apply. Terraform doesn’t run these scripts multiple times. 

### There are many provisioners available. They help in:

- local script execution on the machine from where we are running terraform
- remote script execution on resource
- file or directory copy on the remote resource
- configure and run configuration management tools on the remote resource.
- Bootstrapping a virtual machine for a config manager.

### Types of provisioners 

- remote-exec
  The remote-exec provisioner allows us to connect to a remote machine via Windows Remote Management (WinRM) or Secure Shell (SSH) and run a script remotely.
  
- local-exec
   We may wish to run a script locally as part of our Terraform configuration by using the local-exec provisioner.
   
#### Example of usage

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo The server's IP address is ${self.private_ip}"
  }
}
```
